#GPS 1.1 Release 7

> Answer these questions in your reflection:

1) **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

* I thought I understood a lot of it prior to the session but then I quickly realized I was struggling with the GitHub concepts. For some reason I was thinking that I needed to keep creating new repos when working on new branches or exercises. I knew repos were "secret" folders but didn't grasp the whole picture of it until after the session.

2) **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

* GitHub process of making sure we added & committed were clarified

3) **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

* I asked my pair about the merge conflict info. I was thinking the conflict was fixed and viewed only in the command line and didn't realize that it appeared right in the file

4) **What still confuses you about Git?**

* For now, it seems like it makes a lot of sense and hopefully practice will make it even better

5) How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* I'm glad the guide and my partner were very patient with the process, so it made it a good experience
