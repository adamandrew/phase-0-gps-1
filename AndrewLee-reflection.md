# GPS 1.1 Reflection

* I struggled the most on GitHub prior to GPS because there are just too many buttons.
* The concepts on add and commnit are clarified during GPS
* I asked my pair about markdown syntax and inline image.
* I'm pretty confident now thanks to the GPS
* The GPS lasts for 2 hours since we are both first time and not familiar with a lot of things but it is very helpful.
